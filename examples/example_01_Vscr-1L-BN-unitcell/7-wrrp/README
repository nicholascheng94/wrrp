Here we choose to use the conventional BerkeleyGW shifted-grid approach to handle the q-->0 (q0) point, so we set use_wavg = .true. and use_ss = .false. .
In this scheme we rely on BerkeleyGW Monte Carlo averaging scheme to get the correct value for the head element of W, i.e. W(q=0, G=G'=0). 
This value is stored in the wrrp.wcoul0 file, which is produced by sigma.*.x of the modified BerkelyGW (qmap) code, and we link it to the current directory.
We link the eps0mat and epsmat files from the BerkeleyGW calculations.
wrrp.qfbz and wrrp.qibz are the list of q-points in the full and irreducible BZs, respectively, and are needed in order to map q-points from the irreducible to the full BZ.
The data are copied directly from the WFN.log file generated by BerkeleyGW's kgrid.x program. 
The full BZ q-points are listed under 'k-points in the original uniform grid', while the irreducible BZ q-points are listed under 'k-points in the irreducible wedge'.

In order to plot the planar average of Vscr, you must modify wrrp.f90 as follows:
- under the "WRITE OUTPUT FILES" section (toward the end of the file), uncomment the lines in the "PLANAR AVERAGE OF f(r,r) ALONG z" subsection
- under the "WRITE OUTPUT FILES" section (toward the end of the file), comment the lines in the "BINARY OUTPUT FILE" and "2D CONTOUR PLOT OF f(r,r') WITH FIXED r'" subsections
- re-compile wrrp
