Here we do not need a fully converged calculation; we only want to produce the 'gmapdata' file. 
We therefore do not need many unoccupied bands.
Note that we only need to run at a single k-point, but this k-point must have the symmetry of the full BZ (i.e. we must choose a q-point from the output of epsilon.cplx.x whose nrk is equal to the total number of k-points in the full BZ).
