K_POINTS obtained from WFN.out in ../00-kgrid directory
In order to use the NNS scheme (step 3), you *must* run BerkeleyGW's subsample_plan.x program as follows:
	subsample_plan.x BIN wfn.cplx
Change the WFN format (BIN) and WFN filename (wfn.cplx) as needed. 
Please refer to BerkeleyGW's documentation for more information on running the subsample_plan.x code.
