Here we choose to use the nonuniform neck subsampling (NNS) scheme to handle the q-->0 (q0) point, so we set use_wavg = .false. and use_ss = .true. .
In this scheme the special q-->0 (q0s) points are assigned weight that are written to 'subweights.dat' by subsample_plan.x.
When using wrrp with NNS you must link the 'subweights.dat' file to the wrrp directory.
We link the eps0mat and epsmat files from the BerkeleyGW calculations.
wrrp.qfbz and wrrp.qibz are the list of q-points in the full and irreducible BZs, respectively, and are needed in order to map q-points from the irreducible to the full BZ.
The data are copied directly from the WFN.log file generated by BerkeleyGW's kgrid.x program.
The full BZ q-points are listed under 'k-points in the original uniform grid', while the irreducible BZ q-points are listed under 'k-points in the irreducible wedge'.

In order to plot the 3D rho_ind(r,r'), you must modify wrrp.f90 as follows:
- under the "WRITE OUTPUT FILES" section (toward the end of the file), comment the lines in the "PLANAR AVERAGE OF f(r,r) ALONG z" and "2D CONTOUR PLOT OF f(r,r') WITH FIXED r'" subsections
- under the "WRITE OUTPUT FILES" section (toward the end of the file), uncomment the lines in the "BINARY OUTPUT FILE" "PLANAR AVERAGE OF f(r,r) ALONG z" subsection
- re-compile wrrp

To generate a file that can be plotted using xcrysden:
- re-compile read_datarrp using the read_datarrp.f90 in this folder
- A few .xsf files will be generated. However, you need to add in the lattice vectors and atomic coordinates manually.
- To generate the lattice vectors and atomic coordinates for the supercell, a companion utility struct_sc is provided
  - In the input file 'pts', input the unit cell lattice vectors, number of atoms, atomic coordinates, and supercell size
    - Note that units are in **angstroms**
  - Run struct_sc.x and the supercell coordinates are found in file 'sc_pts'
- Input lattice vectors and atomic coordinates in the xsf file, under headings 'PRIMVEC' and 'PRIMCOORD'
- Under section 'BEGIN_BLOCK_DATAGRID_3D', the lattice vectors are to be replaced by the output, which currently always outputs zeros
- Visualize the xsf file using xcrysden
