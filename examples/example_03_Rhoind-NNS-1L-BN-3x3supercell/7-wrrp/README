Here we choose to use the nonuniform neck sampling (NNS) scheme to handle the q-->0 (q0) point, so we set use_wavg = .false. and use_ss = .true. .
In this scheme the special q-->0 (q0s) points are assigned weight that are written to 'subweights.dat' by subsample_plan.x.
When using wrrp with NNS you must link the 'subweights.dat' file to the wrrp directory.
We link the eps0mat and epsmat files from the BerkeleyGW calculations.
wrrp.qfbz and wrrp.qibz are the list of q-points in the full and irreducible BZs, respectively, and are needed in order to map q-points from the irreducible to the full BZ.
The data are copied directly from the WFN.log file generated by BerkeleyGW's kgrid.x program. 
The full BZ q-points are listed under 'k-points in the original uniform grid', while the irreducible BZ q-points are listed under 'k-points in the irreducible wedge'.

In order to plot the 3D rho_ind(r,r'), you must modify wrrp.f90 as follows:
- under the "WRITE OUTPUT FILES" section (toward the end of the file), comment the lines in the "PLANAR AVERAGE OF f(r,r) ALONG z" and "2D CONTOUR PLOT OF f(r,r') WITH FIXED r'" subsections
- under the "WRITE OUTPUT FILES" section (toward the end of the file), uncomment the lines in the "BINARY OUTPUT FILE" "PLANAR AVERAGE OF f(r,r) ALONG z" subsection
- re-compile wrrp
