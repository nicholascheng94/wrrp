Here we choose to use the conventional BerkeleyGW shifted-grid approach to handle the q-->0 (q0) point, so we set use_wavg = .true. and use_ss = .false. in wrrp.inp .
In this scheme we rely on BerkeleyGW Monte Carlo averaging scheme to get the correct value for the head element of W, i.e. W(q=0, G=G'=0). 
This value is stored in the wrrp.wcoul0 file, which is produced by sigma.*.x of the modified BerkelyGW (qmap) code, and we link it to the current directory.
Since we are dealing with bulk Si (1-10) we turn off slab Coulomb truncation, use_slab = .false. in wrrp.inp .
We link the eps0mat and epsmat files from the BerkeleyGW calculations.
wrrp.qfbz and wrrp.qibz are the list of q-points in the full and irreducible BZs, respectively, and are needed in order to map q-points from the irreducible to the full BZ.
The data are copied directly from the WFN.log file generated by BerkeleyGW's kgrid.x program. 
The full BZ q-points are listed under 'k-points in the original uniform grid', while the irreducible BZ q-points are listed under 'k-points in the irreducible wedge'.

In order to plot the planar average of Vscr, you must modify wrrp.f90 as follows:
- under the "WRITE OUTPUT FILES" section (toward the end of the file), uncomment the lines in the "2D CONTOUR PLOT OF f(r,r') WITH FIXED r'" subsection
- note that the location of r' is given in terms of the FFT index
- under the "WRITE OUTPUT FILES" section (toward the end of the file), comment the lines in the "BINARY OUTPUT FILE" and "PLANAR AVERAGE OF f(r,r) ALONG z" subsections
- re-compile wrrp
