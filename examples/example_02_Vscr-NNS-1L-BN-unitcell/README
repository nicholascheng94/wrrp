Example 01
Planar average of the screening potential, Vscr(r,r), for 1L BN using BerkeleyGW's NNS scheme. 

# How to run this example
1.	Run linkscript.sh in order to create the required dynamic links (don't worry that the linked files don't exist yet!)
	N.B. Depending on your version of Quantum ESPRESSO, the charge-density and data-file files might have  names or extensions different from those in linkfiles.sh
	They will, however, always be located in the $PREFIX.save directory of the SCF calculation (./1-scf). 
	Be sure to link the correct files!
2a.	Run SCF calculations ('in' files) in steps 1-3 with pw.x (Quantum ESPRESSO)
2b.	Convert Quantum ESPRESSO output to BerkeleyGW format ('pw2bgw.in' files) in steps 1-3 with pw2bgw.x (Quantum ESPRESSO)
3.	Run step 4 with epsilon.cplx.x (BerkeleyGW)
4.	Run step 5 with epsilon.cplx.x (*modified* BerkeleyGW qmap)
5.	Run step 6 with sigma.cplx.x (*modified* BerkeleyGW qmap)
5.	Run step 7 with wrrp.cplx.x (be sure to modifiy wrrp.f90 to ensure the correct output type - see README in step 7 directory)

# Notes
- see the README files in the directories for additional comments
- please refer to the BerkeleyGW documentation for more information on running the epsilon and sigma programs.
- the outputs in step 00 were obtained using the BerkeleyGW kgrid.x utility
- the outputs in step 0 were obtained using the BerkeleyGW gsphere.py utility
- using 40 cores, the calculations should take roughly 1 hour to complete in total
