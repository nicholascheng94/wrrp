Here we are using BerkeleyGW's nonuniform neck sampling (NNS) method to deal with the q-->0 (q0) point. 
See the README file in step 3 for more information on running the susbsample_plan.x code, which generates the files required for NNS.
The special q-points (q0s) are in the 'epsilon_q0s.inp' file generated by subsample_plan.x; these points replace the conventional q0 point (see Example 01, step 4).
Note that in a small system, such as 1L BN, we can easily deal with all q0s points at once, together with the regular non-q0 points. 
In a large system, however, it maybe necessary to split the epsilon calculation into multiple calculation, each dealing with a specific q0s point.
In this case you must run step 3 once for each q0s point, replacing the K_POINTS in the input file with the corresponding kpoints_*.dat file generated by subsample_plan.x .
The subsequently generated eps0mat files must then be combined using epsmat_merge.x. 
Please refer to the BerkeleyGW documentation for more information.
