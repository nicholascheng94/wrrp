## Description
wrrp.x is a Fortran code that performs six-dimensional (6D) inverse Fourier transforms on inverse dielectric matrices generated using [BerkeleyGW](https://berkeleygw.org/). The reference associated with this work is

## Features
- Real-space representation of the screening potential, inverse dielectric matrices, polarizability matrices in a user-specified supercell
- OpenMP parallelization

## Usage

### Compilation
wrrp.x can be compiled with both `ifort` and `gfortran`. The following dependecies are required:
- Intel MKL *or*
- fftw2 and LAPACK

To compile the complex version of the code using ifort and Intel MKL:
```
./cplx.sh
```

### Running the code
Input files
- Input file `wrrp.inp`. See `wrrp.inp` in this directory for input parameters.
- q-point information `wrrp.qibz` and `wrrp.qfbz`. The input is extracted from the BerkeleyGW `kgrid.x` log file. 
- Inverse dielectric matrices `epsmat` and `eps0mat` generated using BerkeleyGW
- (If using Monte Carlo averaging to treat q -> 0 limit in W and V) `wrrp.wcoul0` (Refer to 1. in Notes)
- (If using non-uniform neck subsampling) `subweights.dat` generated using BerkeleyGW
- (If using symmetry operations) `isortg` and `gmapdata`

Output files
- `data_rrp.bin` contains the final result in real space for further post-processing.

### Notes
1. **Generation of `wrrp.wcoul0`** requires the user to explicitly write out the Monte Carlo averaged value of the q -> 0 limit in W and V during the computation of the self-energies at the Sigma step in BerkeleyGW. Refer to Computer Physics Communications 183 (2012) 1269â€“1289 for further discussion. We provide a patch in `wcoul0.patch` which enables Sigma to explicitly output `wrrp.wcoul0`.

2. **Symmetry operations.** The computation of the inverse dielectric matrices exploits symmetry operations to enable calculations within the irreducible Brillouin zone. In order to correctly include the symmetry operations in calculations using wrrp.x, the user is required to compute `isortg` and `gmapdata` at the Epsilon and Sigma step in BerkeleyGW, respectively. We provide a patch in `irrbz.patch` which enables the user to generate `isortg` and `gmapdata` without computing the inverse dielectric matrix and the self-energies respectively. Note that if the files `isortg` and `gmapdata` are not provided, the inverse dielectric matrix must be computed in the full Brillouin zone to give correct results.
